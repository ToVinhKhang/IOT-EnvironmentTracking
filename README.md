## IOT-EnvironmentTracking
This is my school project about IOT Fundamentals.

<br>

## Components included:
• ESP32 DevKitC
• DHT-11
• PIR HC-SR501
• LCD 1602 I2C
• LED
• BUZZER

<br>

## Cloud service:
ThingSpeak

<br>

## Run project:
### Simulation:
1/ In CiscoPacketTracer > Open file simulation.pkt
<br>

2/ Click to SBC-PT (ESP32) > Programming > Run
<br>

3/ Press Alt and hover mouse to Motion Sensor (PIR HC-SR501)
<br>

4/ End.

<br>

### Reality:
1/ Add all libraries needed to folder "libraries"
<br>

2/ In ArduinoIDE > Open file reality.ino
<br>

3/ Connect ESP32 with your Laptop by USB
<br>

4/ Change correct Wifi with Username and Password
<br>

4/ Change correct Write APIKEY of your ThingSpeak account
<br>

5/ Click "Verify" to make sure everything work
<br>

6/ Click "Upload" to add code to ESP32
<br>

7/ Now your code is ready to use
<br>

8/ End.
